# Zesty_Portfolio

## Description

This is my current portfolio that I created using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolios assignments we previously worked on did not feel like my design and I wanted to showcase something that felt more personalized. I added colors and really wanted to make it POP!

Allthough this portfolio page doesn't demonstrate all my coding capabilities it was fun to work on.
