                    <p>Full Stack web developer skilled in HTML5, CSS3, Git, and GitHub. Thrives on the challenge of learning new technologies and the satisfaction of solving difficult problems with creative solutions. I’m currently enrolled in a Full Stack bootcamp through the University of Denver to expand my skills and move into a Web Developer role. </p>
                    <p>Recently completed a group project working with two other individuals to create an application that allows the user to search for National Parks within a specific state. The user will also be provided with a 5 day weather forecast, 3 random activities to do at the park, and a map of the park’s location. The project utilized APIs, Bulma, and a significant amount of JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>A background in Benefits Administration and Human Resources gives me a customer-focused mentality and the ability to keep a project aligned with the needs of the end-user. I now apply this process to my work as a developer by researching challenging issues that affect usability and accessibility and effectively collaborating with my team.</p>
